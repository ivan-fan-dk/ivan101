    "If we want to count how many fingers there are in two hands, we can think in the following way:\n",

    "There are five fingers on the left hand, and there are five fingers on the right hand. So, in total, there are ten fingers.\n",

    "## Calculation Strategy\n",
    "There are some different tricks regarding how to add numbers together. If the reader can add two small numbers, then he/she can certainly add two large numbers. The idea is to **add the digits pairwise from right to left**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example. If you know that $3+4=7$ and $1+5=6$, then it's easy to calculate $31+45$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It becomes clear when we show the calculation in vertical format. So, let's do that. Remember to write digits in the same position below each other like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{matrix} & 3 & 1 \\\\ + & 4 & 5 \\\\ \\hline  \\\\ \\end{matrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can start calculating. We add digits from the right side. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since $1+5=6$, we write the digit $6$ below the horizontal line in the same column where $1$ and $5$ are placed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we write the digit $7$ in the same column where $3$ and $4$ are placed, since $3+4=7$. Finally, we get,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{matrix} & 3 & 1 \\\\ + & 4 & 5 \\\\ \\hline & 7 & 6 \\end{matrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can read the answer directly: $31+45=76$. Is it clear?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some small details to be mindful of, for example, **what should we do if the sum of two digits exceeds $9$?**\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, you can follow the following method.\n",

    "```{admonition} General addition strategy\n",
