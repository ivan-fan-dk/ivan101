# Introduction

## What is this?
This is a **open-source** collection of math notes for primary and secondary school students.

## Who are we?
Ivan: I am Ivan. I am a university student who majors in math. I have a passion for math and I want to share it with you.
Erik: I study at DTU and love pure math, it tickles my brain. 

## Why are we doing this?
Ivan: I am a math tutor and I have been tutoring since 2023. I have seen many students who are struggling with math either because they are afraid of math, or they have no idea about it. I want to help students who are struggling with math. I want to make math fun and easy to learn.

Erik: Tutor here as well. Too many danish high school students hate math, which is a shame, because it can reach the highest highs if you "get it". I'm hoping to help people understand the intuitions behind some of the god-given formulas, and why they work.
